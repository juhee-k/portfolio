# Juhee Kim's React Portfolio
I am a full stack software engineer with a background in Digital Media and Graphic Design. I am proficient in Illustrator, Photoshop and Microsoft office Suite. I enjoy creating an organized environment and creating ways to increase efficiency and productivity in the workplace.

My portfolio site has the sites that I have built with html/css, Java Script, React, Wordpress, Wix, Duda and as well as the brochure, flyer, buisess cards that were created by using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I have done more than portfolios and pretty sure that I will make more and better!
